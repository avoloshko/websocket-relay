# What is Yahoo Stock Quotes?
It's Node.js app to get stock quotes from Yahoo.

Recently Yahoo has shut down the Finance API. The web service parses web pages like `http://yahoo.com/quote/AAPL` to retrieve the necessary data.

It's fast and robust. Both HTML and REST are avaialble to add/remove stock symbols.

## Supported features

* REST API provides fast compressed output
* Quotes are kept in memory and periodically saved to the file system
* Log files with daily rotation
* Processing 20 pages / sec on EC2 (t2.micro)
* Suspend processing after the normal trading hours (09.30 - 16.00)
